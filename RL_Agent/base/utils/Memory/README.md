# Memory

This package contains the two main types of memory the agents use. 
- Queue Experience replay Memory [deque_memory.py](https://github.com/SergioHdezG/RL_library/blob/master/Memory/deque_memory.py)
- Prioritized Experience Replay Memory [per_memory.py](https://github.com/SergioHdezG/RL_library/blob/master/Memory/memory_super.py)
  - [sum_tree](https://github.com/SergioHdezG/RL_library/blob/master/Memory/sum_tree.py) Is an util for implementing PER Memory

Both under the same interfaz inherited from [memory-super.py](https://github.com/SergioHdezG/RL_library/blob/master/Memory/memory_super.py)
